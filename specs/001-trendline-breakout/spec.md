## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a trader using an algorithmic trading system, I need the system to automatically detect when price breaks through established trendlines across multiple timeframes, so that I can identify high-probability trade setups without manually monitoring charts.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** price data with an established trendline that has 3+ touch points on the 4-hour timeframe, **When** the price closes above the trendline resistance, **Then** the system detects and records a breakout event with the trendline details and breakout timestamp.

2. **Given** multiple trendlines exist on different timeframes (1h, 4h, daily), **When** evaluating potential breakouts, **Then** the system ranks breakouts based on trendline quality (number of touchpoints, timeframe strength) and identifies which qualify as high-priority setups.

3. **Given** a detected trendline break, **When** supply/demand levels also align with the breakout direction, **Then** the system flags this as an "A+ trade setup" due to multiple confirmations.

4. **Given** price approaching a trendline, **When** the trendline has only 2 touch points, **Then** the system assigns it a lower priority ranking compared to trendlines with 3+ touch points.

5. **Given** historical price data across multiple cryptocurrency pairs, **When** running backtest analysis, **Then** the system identifies all past trendline breakouts that met the ranking criteria and reports their subsequent price movements.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when two trendlines on different timeframes break simultaneously?
- How does the system handle false breakouts (price briefly crosses trendline but reverses)?
- What happens when trendline touch points are very close together in time versus well-distributed?
- How does the system prioritize when multiple coins have breakouts at the same time?
- What happens with trendlines during periods of extremely low or high volatility?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Trendline Detection
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect trendlines with a minimum of 3 touch points across multiple timeframes (1h, 4h, daily, weekly)
- **FR-002**: System MUST calculate and store the number of touch points for each detected trendline
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify both upward (support) and downward (resistance) trendlines
- **FR-004**: System MUST recalculate trendlines as new price data becomes available

#### Trendline Ranking
- **FR-005**: System MUST rank trendlines based on quality factors including number of touch points, timeframe, touch point distribution (temporal spread), trendline angle/slope, and duration
- **FR-006**: System MUST prioritize trendlines with 3+ touch points higher than those with only 2 touch points
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply two-tier timeframe weighting where weekly and daily timeframes are classified as high priority, while 4h and 1h timeframes are classified as standard priority

#### Breakout Detection (Break of Structure)
- **FR-008**: System MUST detect when price breaks through a trendline using a three-stage confirmation: (1) candle closes beyond trendline, (2) price retests the trendline, (3) retest is rejected (price bounces away from line)
- **FR-009**: System MUST record the timestamp, price, and trendline details for each breakout event including confirmation stage
- **FR-010**: System MUST distinguish between upward breakouts (through resistance) and downward breakouts (through support)
- **FR-011**: System MUST track breakout confirmation status through all three stages: initial break, retest, and rejection

#### Supply and Demand Integration
- **FR-012**: System MUST detect supply and demand levels from historical price data
- **FR-013**: System MUST determine when supply/demand levels align with trendline breakout direction
- **FR-014**: System MUST consider a supply/demand level as aligned when it is within 2% price distance of the breakout point

#### A+ Trade Setup Identification
- **FR-015**: System MUST flag trades as "A+ setups" when multiple confirmation criteria are met
- **FR-016**: A+ setup MUST include: trendline with 3+ touch points being broken AND supply/demand alignment
- **FR-017**: System MUST require higher timeframe trend alignment and volume spike confirmation at breakout, in addition to 3+ touch points and supply/demand alignment, for A+ setup classification
- **FR-018**: System MUST rank A+ setups relative to each other based on confluence strength (number of confirming factors present) and recency (most recent setups ranked higher)

#### Multi-Asset Coverage
- **FR-019**: System MUST analyze cryptocurrency pairs ranked in the top 50 by market capitalization
- **FR-020**: System MUST fetch and process price data for all selected cryptocurrency pairs
- **FR-021**: System MUST update the list of top 50 pairs weekly to reflect market capitalization changes
- **FR-022**: System MUST maintain stable asset coverage to avoid excessive churn in monitored pairs

#### Backtesting Support
- **FR-023**: System MUST process historical price data to identify past trendline breakouts
- **FR-024**: System MUST calculate performance metrics for identified breakouts over adaptive time horizons that scale with the trendline timeframe
- **FR-025**: System MUST maintain consistency between backtest detection logic and real-time detection logic
- **FR-026**: System MUST calculate Sortino ratio (downside risk-adjusted returns), profit factor (gross profits / gross losses), and maximum drawdown (peak-to-trough decline)

#### Data Management
- **FR-027**: System MUST store detected trendlines with sufficient detail to recreate them later
- **FR-028**: System MUST store breakout events with timestamp, price, associated trendline, and confirmation status
- **FR-029**: System MUST store supply/demand levels with price range and strength indicators
- **FR-030**: System MUST retain all historical trendline and breakout data indefinitely to support long-term backtesting and pattern analysis

### Key Entities

- **Trendline**: A line connecting price highs or lows over time; characterized by direction (support/resistance), touch point count, touch point timestamps and prices, timeframe, slope/angle, creation timestamp, validity status
- **Touch Point**: A price point where the asset price touches or comes very close to an established trendline; characterized by timestamp, price, distance from trendline, confirmation status
- **Breakout Event**: An occurrence where price crosses and closes beyond a trendline; characterized by timestamp, price, direction (upward/downward), associated trendline, confirmation status, subsequent price movement
- **Supply/Demand Level**: A price zone where historical buying or selling pressure was significant; characterized by price range (high/low), strength indicator, formation type (supply/demand), touch count, timeframe
- **A+ Trade Setup**: A high-confidence trading opportunity; characterized by trendline quality score, breakout details, supply/demand alignment status, overall confidence score, additional confirmation factors
- **Cryptocurrency Pair**: A trading pair being analyzed; characterized by symbol, liquidity metrics, current price, active trendlines, recent breakouts, monitoring status
